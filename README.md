# FitLife-Tracker---Data-Management
  Here is the code pack to our FitLife Tracker website.

To run the code:

You will first need MySQLBench and start a schema called 'fitlifetracker'. Then from the uploaded .sql file in this repository copy its content onto it.

After that download the rest of the files.

To start up first. open up the Login.html file. To login use the account of username: 'user' and password 'user'.

From there you will have access to the website.

The website has a long way to go in the future where we can implement it into various health metric softwares.
