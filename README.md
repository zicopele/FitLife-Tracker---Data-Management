# FitLife-Tracker---Data-Management
  Here is the code pack to our FitLife Tracker website.

To run the code, you might want to start in the login.html (we already have an account made where username: user, password: user)
From there you can see the different types of exercises, the index page, the profile submition page which will update the database, and the history page that should show the history done by the account.
